### Warnings ⚠️ (Should Fix)

#### Warning 1: Average Rating Calculation

**File:** `lib/features/reviews/data/repositories/review_repository_impl.dart`  
**Line:** 87  
**Category:** PERFORMANCE

**Description:**
Average rating is calculated on every query, which could be inefficient for products with many reviews.

**Suggestion:**

```dart
// Add caching
@riverpod
Future<double> averageRating(
  AverageRatingRef ref,
  String productId,
) async {
  ref.cacheFor(const Duration(minutes: 5));
  final repository = ref.watch(reviewRepositoryProvider);
  return repository.getAverageRating(productId);
}
```
````

**Priority:** Low

---

### Suggestions 💡 (Nice to Have)

#### Suggestion 1: Add Review Sorting Options

**Description:**
Currently reviews are sorted by newest only. Consider adding sort options (highest rated, lowest rated, most helpful).

**Benefit:**
Better user experience and flexibility.

**Priority:** Low

#### Suggestion 2: Add Review Pagination

**Description:**
For products with many reviews, consider implementing pagination.

**Benefit:**
Better performance and UX for products with 100+ reviews.

**Priority:** Low
