# ======================================================
# Kiro Engineering Command: Auto Governance & Compliance
# ======================================================

@Directive: Establish autonomous governance, compliance, and policy-intelligence systems across the full software ecosystem.
@Mode: self_governing_autonomy
@Behavior: continuous_policy_validation_and_self_regulation
@Scope: global_project_and_operational_layers

@Goal: Enable Kiro to automatically monitor, validate, and enforce adherence to technical, legal, and ethical standards throughout all stages of project development and deployment.

@Governance_Principles:
  - Compliance with international standards (ISO/IEC 27001, OWASP, GDPR, SOC 2).
  - Enforcement of secure coding and privacy-by-design principles.
  - Autonomous auditing and policy revision cycles.
  - Zero manual oversight; adaptive response to compliance deviations.

@Tasks:
  1. **Policy Discovery & Definition:**
     - Analyze all existing project policies, codebases, and configurations.
     - Generate a unified governance schema under `.kiro/policies/`.

  2. **Continuous Compliance Validation:**
     - Run automated scans for violations, misconfigurations, and risk vectors.
     - Apply fixes autonomously when within permitted boundaries.
     - Escalate critical issues to user via structured report.

  3. **Self-Auditing & Reporting:**
     - Maintain ongoing self-assessment cycles.
     - Generate compliance metrics and benchmark reports automatically.
     - Store reports under `.kiro/logs/governance/`.

  4. **Adaptive Learning:**
     - Update policy engine with each cycle to reflect new regulatory frameworks.
     - Integrate findings into `.kiro/knowledge/` for long-term optimization.
